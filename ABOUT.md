## Best Strategy for Warming Up Emails

The best strategy for warming up emails involves:

1. **Start slow**: Begin with just 2-4 emails per day
2. **Gradually increase volume**: Add a few emails every few days, working up to your target volume
3. **Ensure high engagement**: Our system ensures emails are opened and replied to
4. **Configure DNS properly**: Verify SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
5. **Monitor deliverability**: Track metrics like inbox placement, open rates, and spam rates
6. **Allow sufficient time**: Complete at least 4 weeks of warmup before high-volume marketing
7. **Continue warmup activities**: Even after the initial period, maintain some warmup activity

This approach convinces email service providers that your accounts are legitimate senders with good engagement, ensuring your marketing emails reach the primary inbox instead of spam folders.
